# Security Vulnerabilities Test Suite

## Testing Your Security Scanners

### SCA Testing
1. Run your SCA tool against `requirements.txt` (Python)
2. Run your SCA tool against `package.json` (Node.js)
3. Verify detection of vulnerable dependencies and CVEs

### SAST Testing
1. Run your SAST tool against Python files:
   - `python_sast_vulnerabilities.py`
   - `python_additional_vulnerabilities.py`
2. Run your SAST tool against JavaScript files:
   - `javascript_sast_vulnerabilities.js`
3. Verify detection of code-level security issues

### IaC Testing
1. Run your IaC scanner against:
   - `Dockerfile`
   - `docker-compose.yml`
   - `kubernetes-deployment.yaml`
   - `terraform-main.tf`
2. Verify detection of infrastructure misconfigurations

## Expected Detections

Your security scanners should detect:

### High Severity
- SQL Injection
- Command Injection
- Hardcoded credentials
- Insecure deserialization
- XXE vulnerabilities
- SSRF vulnerabilities
- Privileged containers
- Public cloud resources
- Weak database credentials

### Medium Severity
- Weak cryptography
- Insecure random numbers
- Path traversal
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Missing authentication
- Exposed debugging ports
- No encryption at rest
- Missing security headers

### Low Severity
- Information disclosure
- Debug mode enabled
- Missing resource limits
- No logging configuration
- Latest tags in containers
- No health checks

## Important Notes

⚠️ **WARNING**: These files contain real security vulnerabilities and should:
- NEVER be deployed to production
- NEVER be committed to production repositories
- Only be used in isolated testing environments
- Be deleted after testing is complete

## Security Scanner Comparison

Use these files to compare the effectiveness of different security scanning tools:
- Detection rate (how many vulnerabilities are found)
- False positive rate
- Severity accuracy
- Remediation guidance quality
- Reporting capabilities
